# HushHush Recruiter

HushHush Recruiter is an automation tool built in Python that identifies, extracts, and evaluates potential candidates from online platforms such as GitHub.  
The goal is to silently (“hush-hush”) analyze developers' activity, skills, repositories, and engagement to help shortlist top candidates for interviews or team hiring.

This tool can be extended for HR screening, automated candidate sourcing, or ranking technical talent based on publicly available signals.
